# Run the model

All network files are included in the `model` folder, ready to use. Just the origin-destination tables must be generated for each region with the correspondingly named notebook in the `notebooks` folder: Load the network files (instead of generating them anew) and run the pathfinders in the bottom section of the notebook.

With the origin-destination tables generated, you are able to run the simplified activity-based transport model. Open the `decent_mobility_modelling` notebook, enter the desired region name ("Port Louis" or "Vacoas") in the second cell, run it, have a look at the figures, and change it to your needs.
